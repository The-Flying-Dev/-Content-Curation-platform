Creating muscle memory of the basic process of development is a key practice towards becoming a better developer. 
So here I am having just completed another rails app following the guide [ReadIt a Content Curation platform](https://thepeterayeni.medium.com/readit-a-simple-content-curation-platform-build-with-rails-api-and-vanilla-javascript-84a53697fd2c) on medium.com written by Peter Ayeni.<br/>

* The experiment for building this app was to create a second branch ( where all the models were generated ) and merge it back into the master.
